### IoT coffee container

Ehh... I guess the name might seem misleading. I originally was going to mount the electronics to the coffee container but I grossly underestimated how heavy/bulky everything was going to be.

#### About
This is a quick side project, a stepper turns on a power strip that powers a growth light.
I also strapped a camera onto the light so I can schedule screenshots to eventually compose a time lapse of hopefully something growing.

#### Purpose

Only purpose is to schedule the growth light(wall timer) and take screenshtos for a timelapse. Also will have a web interface to show/filter the images by date.
